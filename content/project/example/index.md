Puzzle Boon suggests possible matches based on three photos â€“ one of the full puzzle image from the puzzle box, one of the puzzle in progress, and one of the remaining puzzle pieces.

With this information, the tool analyses the images and provides suggested matches showing which
remaining piece will fit in which part of the puzzle of progress.

The project solution required several components, including creating a dataset of puzzle piece images, a trained
machine learning model, the means to locate puzzle piece corners and re-orient pieces, some matching
strategies, and a way to communicate the match results.
